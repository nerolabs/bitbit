# Decision ledger

**Status: living record.** The product/strategy decisions silt's owner has made, why,
and what remains open. Each entry separates the **direction** (a decision we can and did
derive) from any **construction** (a primitive that must still be built or researched).
This exists so decisions stop being invisible — a reader (builder, red team, researcher,
user) can see exactly what is settled, what is deferred, and on what basis.

**How these were decided.** The research package (`silt-reviews/research/research-outcome/`,
read-only) was written specifically to answer these questions — each memo ends with a
recommendation. So the *directions* below are **derived from the accepted research**, not
re-opened. New research is commissioned only where a memo self-flags a wall (a primitive
that does not yet exist). Where possible, an independent party should *verify* a derived
direction rather than re-author it.

subset). Superseded per-finding history: [`/archive/`](../archive/).

## D-PRIV — access privacy is a metadata-layer tradeoff, not a blob-layer absolute

- **Status:** ✅ DECIDED (Option A) — 2026-08-05.
- **Research basis:** Memo 01 (private retrieval). The anonymity trilemma (Das et al.,
  IEEE S&P 2018) is a hard wall: against a global adversary you cannot have strong
  anonymity + low bandwidth + low latency at once. A participating node structurally sees
  the keys it routes and serves. Access-unobservability is achievable **at the metadata
  layer** (mixnet transport + private DHT lookup + unlinkable retrieval tokens), **not at
  the blob layer** (PIR/ORAM over multi-GB objects imposes a 10–20× blowup a paid substrate
  cannot pay), and even at the metadata layer it is bounded by anonymity-set size on a
  small network.
- **Direction (decided):** Amend immutable #4 from an absolute ("who fetches what is *never*
  observable") to a **stated, layered tradeoff**: publish-unlinkability is delivered;
  access-unobservability is a metadata-layer goal *held in tension*, bounded by the
  trilemma and anonymity-set size, not guaranteed at the blob layer. What stays absolute is
  the **refusal to surveil** — silt builds no mechanism to log or link who-fetched-what.
  Resolves the standing contradiction with `threat-model.md` (which already concedes access
  patterns are correlatable).
- **Also ship:** the **D3 issuance-mixing** residual (route token issuance over the
  content-blind relay from an ephemeral identity + epoch batching) to close the publisher
  IP+timing link — a build item, not a further decision.
- **Construction deferred:** the full H8 metadata-privacy stack (mixnet + PIR-DHT) is a
  post-M0 build track, not required to make the tenet honest now.

## D-S7 — durability is funded by an internal, non-speculative credit reserve

- **Status:** ▶ DIRECTION DERIVED — 2026-08-05; **construction routed to research.**
- **Research basis:** Memo 07 (durability economics). Cold-data repair that is **token-less
  AND center-less has no existence proof** — every deployed survivor uses a crutch silt
  forbids: a central paymaster (Storj — which filed Chapter 11 in July 2026, trapping
  operator balances), an online paying client (Sia), a token block-reward subsidy
  (Filecoin), or a prepaid token endowment betting on falling costs (Arweave). Every
  center-less, subsidy-less system (Freenet, GNUnet, Swarm-for-cold-data) lets cold data
  decay — silt's exact wound. The memo's blunt conclusion: *if silt refuses even an
  internal, non-speculative, time-shiftable credit reserve, S7 is likely unsolvable.*
- **Direction (derived):** Relax "no token" to **"no *speculative external* token."** Keep
  the internal credit unit, but make credits **durable, escrowable, and forwardable in
  time**, and adopt the memo's triad as the S7 spine:
  1. **Per-object durability escrow** — a prepaid credit reserve that pays repair bounties.
  2. **Auto-skim** — a protocol-fixed fraction of each object's serving revenue routes back
     into *that object's* escrow, so popular data self-funds future repair and cold data
     draws its reserve ("paid by the demand it serves," literally, at the object level).
  3. **Rarest-shard bounty multiplier** — scale the bounty by how under-replicated a stripe
     is, self-healing without a central scheduler.
  This completes the fusion memo 09 already put in the tenets: the durability budget and the
  Sybil budget are **one ledger**. The internal credit reserve is distinct from *standing* —
  standing stays work-backed and coin-free; credits fund *durability*, confer no consensus
  weight.
- **Construction routed to research (the wall memo 07 named):** **center-less
  proof-of-repair** — a succinct proof that a specific coded shard was correctly
  regenerated, checkable by a quorum that cannot read the plaintext (verifiable against the
  erasure-code commitment the network already holds), a false claim slashing the caretaker's
  bond. *This primitive does not exist in deployment.* It is the subject of the incoming
  dedicated durability memo and then a prototype (backlog H7). Until it exists, S7 has a
  funding model but not a verified-repair mechanism.

## D-TAKEDOWN — provable non-globality via a transparency log

- **Status:** ▶ DIRECTION DERIVED — 2026-08-05 (low urgency); **metric routed to research.**
- **Research basis:** Memo 04 (pluralistic takedown). A mechanism strong enough to
  *guarantee* content is gone everywhere *is* the global kill switch silt outlawed; every
  deployed system resolves this by *not* guaranteeing global removal except a legally-forced
  sliver. Pluralism re-centralizes in practice (one default labeler becomes near-universal).
- **Direction (derived):** Adopt the memo's priority order as the H9 roadmap direction — a
  **signed, subscribable revocation/label layer** as the primary mechanism (the quorum
  chain is one high-weight labeler among several), every honored revocation committed to a
  **Certificate-Transparency-style append-only log** with inclusion/consistency proofs (so
  silt can *prove* it never silently or globally censored), threshold/quorum signing on
  revocations, and a **narrow, opt-in, hash-based denylist** scoped to the legally-forced
  sliver and itself committed to the transparency log. Avoid perceptual hashing as a primary
  filter and any single default labeler as the only trust root.
- **Construction routed to research:** a **formal non-globality metric** — a proof/measure
  that a takedown was *not* global (how much survived, on how many independent hosts). Memo
  04 flags this as *"silt's most distinctive contribution — no existing system can currently
  demonstrate it never flipped a global switch."* Unformalized; a research contribution, not
  urgent.

## D-DISCLOSURE — no decryption backdoor at the core layer

- **Status:** ▶ DIRECTION DERIVED — 2026-08-05.
- **Research basis:** Memo 04 §3.6 (accountable disclosure): threshold decryption gives
  quorum-gated de-blinding but reintroduces capture/coercion risk (*who* holds shares under
  *what* legal process becomes the attack surface). Composed with the immutables — B4
  (content-blind by construction) and T3 (the Aslan naming boundary) — and the fresh-eyes
  legal analysis (the content-blind firewall *is* the operator liability shield): a core
  decryption capability would pierce the exact shield silt exists to hold.
- **Direction (derived):** **Never at core.** Silt core holds no capability to decrypt stored
  content and ships no threshold/quorum decryption of it. Accountable disclosure, if it ever
  exists, is an **Aslan-layer** (application/resolver) choice made by parties who can already
  read, never a core capability. This is a bright line, consistent with the content-blind
  firewall; it is a *values/legal* call, not a research question.

## D-CRYPTO-AGILITY — a stated post-V1 track, not a V1 gate

- **Status:** ▶ SCOPE DERIVED — 2026-08-05.
- **Basis:** Gap inventory P1 (harvest-now-decrypt-later): durable ciphertext is
  retro-decryptable if SHA-256 / Ed25519 / AES fall; no crypto-agility/migration framework
  is built. No research memo covers this — but the *scope* call is a priorities question,
  not a research one.
- **Direction (derived):** Explicitly **defer to post-V1** and say so, rather than leave it
  silently open. It is not M0-blocking; PQ migration is a known engineering pattern. If we
  later choose to *build* it, the design (agile primitive negotiation, ciphertext
  re-wrapping under churn) would warrant a research pass then.

## D-ANCHORS — launch anchor set is a launch-config decision

- **Status:** ▶ DEFERRED to launch-config — 2026-08-05.
- **Basis:** Memo 05 already gave the *mechanism* (anchors plural + threshold, shedding on
  the Nakamoto/cost-to-corrupt shed metric — shipped as H4) and immutable #3 governs it.
  *Who* the launch anchors are, how many, and the exact threshold depend on who is actually
  running nodes at launch — an operational decision, not a research or architecture one.
- **Direction (derived):** No decision needed now; defer to the launch-config window. Not a
  pre-red-team blocker.

## What is NOT on this ledger

The following are **build items or tuning knobs**, not owner-level decisions, and live in
their own tracks (`design/m0.md`, ROADMAP, the "evolving" tenet tier):
- bind the DHT `Domain` signal to a transport-observed /24 (H5 residual);
- the D3 issuance-mixing transport (build item under D-PRIV);
- the real-wire adversarial-consensus (D2) test sub-suite;
- economic parameters held in tension — `C_honest` weights, concentration threshold *k*,
  demand-attestation ratio, audit/decay windows, fee pricing.
